COEL is a web-based chemistry simulation framework. COEL's most prominent features include ODE-based simulations of chemical reaction networks and multicompartment reaction networks, with rich options for user interactions with those networks. COEL provides DNA-strand displacement transformations and visualization (and is to our knowledge the first CRN framework to do so), GA optimization of rate constants, expression validation, an application-wide plotting engine, and SBML/Octave/Matlab export. COEL's visually pleasing and intuitive user interface, simulations that run on a large computational grid, reliable database storage, and transactional services make it ideal for collaborative research and education.
Besides chemical reaction networks, COEL provides a unified and extendible environment for the definition and manipulation of complex Boolean and real-valued networks.

COEL framework is built on Grails, Spring, Hibernate, and GridGain technology stack.
